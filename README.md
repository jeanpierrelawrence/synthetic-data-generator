# Synthetic User Data Factory 🚀

A high-speed utility designed to generate randomized, high-accuracy synthetic datasets for automated testing and QA workflows.

## 🛠️ The "High Agency" Experiment
This project was built as a technical exercise to demonstrate the power of **AI-driven development**. Using **Cursor (AI-native IDE)**, I rapidly prototyped this tool to solve a common friction point in the testing lifecycle: the need for instant, formatted test data.

## ✨ Features
* **Automated Data Generation:** Instantly scales from 1 to 100+ records.
* **Precision Logic:** Generates realistic Full Names, correctly formatted Emails, and valid Timestamps with **99% accuracy**.
* **Multi-Format Export:** Supports **JSON** for API testing and **CSV** for spreadsheet-based automation.
* **Responsive Logic:** Built with a "Mobile-First" approach to ensure accessibility across devices.

## 🧠 Technical Highlights
* **Logic-First Design:** Leveraging an **84th percentile in Critical Thinking** to handle randomized data distribution.
* **Efficiency:** Designed for speed, allowing a developer to generate a 100-row dataset in under 1 second.
* **Stack:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), and Cursor AI.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Enter the number of records desired.
2. Click **Generate**.
3. Copy the JSON output or Download the CSV for your automation scripts.
